# monkeclient
client for minecraft but runs on monkeys


Tab enables/disables the tabgui
Pressing right well espand a module, and pressing right on a hack will toggle it
pressing enter/return on hack will open up a settings module, through that you can use arrow keys to select a setting, press enter, and use arrow keys to change settings

Current bugs:
- Randomly getting stuck inside / on the side of blocks (i think this has been fixed but i forgot)
- reach being block reach and not hitting reach, will prob need to trick server for that
- no world icons for some reason....
- freecam just makes a clone, no spectator mode thing

uhh monkey :)
